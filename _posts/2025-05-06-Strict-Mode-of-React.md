Here are the key points:

* [It does not affect the screen that is actually visible to users, and is only activated during development.]
* [It detects and warns of potential problems in advance during development.]
* [If you use an outdated feature, a warning message will be displayed in the console.]
* [Intentionally executing some lifecycle methods twice (e.g. the first time a function like useEffect, useState, etc. is executed) to find code that breaks the rules.]
* [Why use: Prevent future bugs in advance.]
