Here are the key points:

* [In JavaScript, functions can be treated like objects (values).]
* [We can create functions without names in JavaScript.]
* [Hoisting: The phenomenon in which functions are "hoisted" before their code is executed, depending on how they are declared.]
* [Higher-order functions:
- Functions that take other functions as arguments: functions like setTimeout, map, filter
- Functions that return functions]
* [Arrow functions: A new syntax for creating functions that is shorter and more concise.]
* [It is used a lot these days because it makes the code cleaner and avoids 'this' problem.]
