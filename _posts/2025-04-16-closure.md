I looked into 'closure' that were asked in developer interview questions. Here are the key points:

* [A closure is a function (inner function) defined within another function (outer function).]
* [Closures are a special ability of a function to remember and access variables from the environment in which it was created. This allows it to maintain state, hide information, and create reusable code.]
* [Remembered variables can only be accessed and modified by the inner function - they cannot be accessed arbitrarily from outside.]

What I felt:
[I was impressed by the ability to hide important information inside a function from the outside, like a password, and manage it safely, and by being able to create a reusable "my own function" by bundling a specific state and the function that uses that state.]
