Here are the key points:

* [Controlled Component:The current value of the form element is stored in the state of the React component.
When the user changes the value of the input element (the onChange event fires), React detects this event and updates the state value using setState().
When the state value is updated, React re-renders the component and sets the value property of the form element to the updated state value.]
* [Uncontrolled Component:The value of the form element is stored directly in the DOM, just like a normal HTML form element.
React doesn't know directly that the input value has changed.
To get the value of the form element, we have to access the DOM element directly using the useRef() hook.]
* [React's Controlled Component has the characteristic of clearly managing data flow by two-way binding of the state and UI element's value properties.]
