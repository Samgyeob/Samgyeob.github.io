Here are the key points:

* [JavaScript (Array) is an ordered list-type object that can store multiple values ​​in a single data structure.]
* [ex) const array = [1, 'apple', true, { key: 'value' }];]
* [One of its features is that it is a dynamic array. This means that you do not have to specify the size of the array in advance, and the size of the array is automatically adjusted as you add elements.]
* [When you assign a value to a specific index in an array, the array automatically expands.]

What I felt:
[Why can it automatically resize itself?]
