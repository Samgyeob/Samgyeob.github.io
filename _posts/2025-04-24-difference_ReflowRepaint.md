Here are the key points:

* [Reflow: Changes to the structure, size, and location of web pages → have a significant impact on performance]
* [Repaint: Change the color, background, and style of the web page → Less impactful than Reflow]
* [When creating a web page, it is important to take care not to reflow frequently to improve performance.]

What I felt:
[I felt it was important to minimize rearrangement of UI elements and only update them when necessary.]
