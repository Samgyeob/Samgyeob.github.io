Here are the key points:

* [Props(Properties): Data passed from parent component to child component, child component cannot change received props]
* [State: Data managed by the component itself, you can change the state value using a special function called setState() inside the component. When the state changes, React redraws the component on the screen (re-rendering).]
* [Child components cannot directly change the parent's state. Instead, the parent component passes a function as props, and the child component passes data to the parent by calling this function when a specific event occurs.]

[I miss my parents.]
